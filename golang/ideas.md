## Go's OO

- Methods provide message sending mechanism on any type

- Interfaces provide reusability through dynamic dispatch polymorphism

## Concurrency
- Concurrency is not parallelism. ... Concurrency is about ***dealing with*** lots of things at once. Parallelism is about ***doing*** lots of things at once. -- Rob Pike
